## 📻 A Trip Down Memory Lane...

Remember the days when music was just music? No feeds, no ads, no constant notifications. Just you, a glowing screen, and that incredibly satisfying *click-click-click* as your thumb glided over the wheel. 

**Web Classic** brings back the golden era of portable music. It's a fully functional, offline-ready music player that lives right in your browser or on your phone as a native-feeling app.

## ✨ Features

*   🔄 **The Click Wheel:** Fully interactive! Drag your mouse or finger in a circle to scroll through menus, scrub through songs, and adjust the volume.
*   💿 **Cover Flow 3D:** Browse your albums with the iconic 3D perspective carousel.
*   📱 **True PWA (Installable):** Install it as a standalone app on Android, iOS, or PC. No app stores required!
*   📴 **100% Offline Mode:** Uses Service Workers and IndexedDB. Once your music is loaded, you never need an internet connection again.
*   👆 **Modern Touch Controls:** Touch the progress bar to seek, tap the volume bar, or swipe through menus.
*   🔒 **Total Privacy:** Plays local audio files (`.mp3`, `.m4a`, `.flac`, `.wav`) directly from your device. No data is ever uploaded to the cloud.
